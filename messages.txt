Ist SAP oder IBM besser?:!:To answer this, it's important to clarify which specific smoking-related health issues you are referring to, as the impact of smoking cessation can vary. However, I will provide a general overview that covers several conditions commonly associated with smoking:  1. **Lung Health**: Stopping smoking has an immediate effect on the lungs, reducing the incidence of respiratory infections and symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath. Over months to years, lung function improves, and the decline in lung function slows to a rate similar to nonsmokers, which can ultimately reduce the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  2. **Heart Disease and Stroke**: The risk of heart disease starts to decrease shortly after quitting. Within 1 to 2 years of quitting, your risk of heart attack drops dramatically. For stroke, the risk can decrease to that of a nonsmoker within 2 to 5 years after quitting.  3. **Cancer**: The reduction in cancer risk varies depending on the type of cancer. For example, the risk of lung cancer decreases by about half 10 years after quitting, though it never reaches that of someone who never smoked. For other cancers such as bladder, mouth, and throat, the risk decreases over time after quitting.  4. **Other Health Benefits**: Quitting smoking can improve your sense of taste and smell, improve wound healing, reduce the risk of infertility in women of childbearing age, and lead to better bone health. It also decreases the likelihood of developing complications related to diabetes.  5. **Overall Mortality**: Quitting at any age can give back years of life that would be lost by continuing to smoke. People who quit smoking before the age of 40 reduce their chance of dying prematurely from smoking-related diseases by about 90%, and even those who quit later in life can significantly reduce their risk of death.  6. **Quality of Life**: Beyond the reduction in disease risks, quitting smoking can substantially improve one’s quality of life. This includes having more energy, better immune function, and a cleaner environment (home, car, clothing) free of smoke and its smell.  7. **Psychological Health**: There is evidence that quitting smoking is associated with improvements in mental health such as reductions in depression, anxiety, and stress, and an improvement in positive mood and quality of life compared to continuing to smoke.  It's crucial to note that the benefits of quitting smoking can vary based on factors like how long a person has smoked, their overall health, and at what age they quit. However, it's never too late to quit, and the benefits of quitting begin to take effect almost immediately. Support and resources are available for those looking to stop smoking, including counseling, medication, and nicotine replacement therapies.
